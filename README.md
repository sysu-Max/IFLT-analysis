Ischemia-free procedure reshapes the local and systemic immunity in liver transplantation

Background & Aims: 
An ischemia-free liver transplant (IFLT) procedure has been developed to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We aimed to investigate how this procedure impacts the local and systemic immunity. 

Methods: 
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining, RNA sequencing, as well as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of grafts undergoing IFLT versus conventional liver transplantation (CLT), were used to illustrate the distinct local immunity. Luminex multiplex cytokine analyses and scRNA-seq analyses of peripheral blood from IFLT versus CLT recipients, were conducted to explore the various systemic immunity.

Results: 
In contrast to CLT using static cold storage, IFLT led to reduced neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil extracellular traps formation in the grafts. Twelve donor-derived and four recipient-derived IRI-sensitive clusters were identified with universal downregulation of HIF-1αin IFLT versus CLT grafts. “Porphyrin and heme metabolism” was upregulated with enhanced heme oxygenase-1 expression and diminished inflammasome activation in the monocyte and macrophage clusters of IFLT versus CLT grafts. Systemically, CD8+ effector T cell composition, T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 cytokine levels were reduced, while regulatory T cell composition and Th2 cytokine levels were increased in IFLT versus CLT recipients. 

Conclusion: 
These results show that IFLT can tip the balance from pro- to anti- inflammation locally, and from pro- to anti- rejection systemically.
